== PDFStripper

This is a Rails app that provides a web interface to a Ghostscript command.
That command rewrites uploaded PDF's without the security/usability
restrictions that are commonly found.

The app assumes that it will find the gs binary in /usr/bin/gs
You can make it look elsewhere by creating a config file similar to
config/ghostscript_config.yml.sample
